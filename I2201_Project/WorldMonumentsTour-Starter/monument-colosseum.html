          <h1 style="margin:0 0 10px;">Colosseum</h1>
          <p>The <strong>Colosseum</strong> (also called the Flavian Amphitheatre) sits in the heart of Rome and is one of the most famous surviving buildings of the ancient world. It was created as a massive public arena where thousands of spectators gathered for spectacles — athletic contests, dramas, reenactments, and gladiatorial combat. More than entertainment, the Colosseum was a statement of imperial power and Roman engineering. Built with stone, concrete, and a complex system of arches, it could move crowds efficiently through numbered entrances and tiered seating. Walking through it today, you can still sense how its design shaped modern stadiums: clear sight lines, layered circulation, and structural repetition. The monument matters not only for its history, but as a lesson in how architecture can organize people, emotion, and public life.</p>

          <h2 style="margin-top:18px;">History & significance</h2>
          <p>Construction began under Emperor Vespasian around AD 72 and was completed under Titus around AD 80, with later additions by Domitian. A detail to notice is the <strong>hypogeum</strong> — the underground network of corridors and chambers where animals and stage sets were prepared and lifted into the arena by hoists. Over time, earthquakes and stone‑recycling damaged the structure, but its core form remains an iconic outline of ancient Rome.</p>

          <h2>Visitor notes</h2>
          <p>Go early to avoid crowds, and consider a combined ticket that includes the Roman Forum and Palatine Hill nearby. A guided tour can help you understand the seating levels and underground systems. Wear comfortable shoes (there are uneven stones and stairs) and bring sun protection in summer. After the visit, a short walk to the Forum or Capitoline Hill adds context about how the Colosseum fit into Roman city life.</p>
