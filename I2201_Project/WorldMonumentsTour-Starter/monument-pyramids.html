          <h1 style="margin:0 0 10px;">Pyramids of Giza</h1>
          <p>The <strong>Pyramids of Giza</strong> rise from the desert plateau on the edge of Cairo and are the most famous monuments of ancient Egypt. The complex includes the Great Pyramid of Khufu, the pyramid of Khafre, and the smaller pyramid of Menkaure, along with temples and the nearby Great Sphinx. These structures were built as royal tombs during the Old Kingdom, designed to support beliefs about the afterlife and the pharaoh’s divine role. What makes the pyramids remarkable is the precision: massive stone blocks were aligned carefully, and the overall forms create a powerful sense of order against the open sky. They matter culturally because they are among the oldest surviving wonders of the world, and historically because they show the organization, mathematics, and labor systems of a civilization more than 4,500 years ago.</p>

          <h2 style="margin-top:18px;">History & significance</h2>
          <p>Most construction is dated to around 2600–2500 BCE. Originally, the Great Pyramid was covered in smooth white limestone casing that reflected sunlight, making it shine from far away. Inside, narrow passages lead to chambers that demonstrate the builders’ understanding of weight and stability. Archaeology also reveals worker villages and tool evidence, helping replace old myths with a more realistic story of skilled labor and planning.</p>

          <h2>Visitor notes</h2>
          <p>Arrive early to avoid midday heat and large tour groups, and bring water, sunscreen, and a hat. Stick to official ticket lines and consider a licensed guide to avoid scams around the entrance. The desert ground can be uneven, so comfortable shoes are essential. Nearby, the Egyptian Museum in Cairo and the Saqqara necropolis (with the Step Pyramid) add valuable context if you want a deeper look at Egypt’s pyramid age.</p>
