          <h1 style="margin:0 0 10px;">Petra</h1>
          <p><strong>Petra</strong> is an ancient city in southern Jordan, famous for its dramatic rock‑cut architecture and rose‑colored sandstone cliffs. Reaching Petra often means walking through the narrow <em>Siq</em> — a winding canyon that suddenly opens onto Al‑Khazneh (the Treasury), one of the most photographed façades in the world. Petra was a major hub for the Nabataeans, who controlled trade routes that carried incense, spices, and goods between Arabia, the Mediterranean, and beyond. The city’s importance comes from how it merges landscape and design: tombs, temples, and monuments were carved directly into the rock, creating architecture that feels inseparable from nature. Visiting Petra gives a sense of a “hidden” city shaped by commerce, geology, and ingenious water management that allowed life to flourish in a desert environment.</p>

          <h2 style="margin-top:18px;">History & significance</h2>
          <p>Petra flourished around the 1st century BCE to 1st century CE and later became part of the Roman Empire in 106 CE. Earthquakes and shifting trade routes contributed to decline, and the site was reintroduced to Western audiences in 1812. An interesting detail to notice is the water system: channels, dams, and cisterns captured seasonal rainfall and supported a large population — one of the reasons Petra could thrive where it did.</p>

          <h2>Visitor notes</h2>
          <p>Start early and bring water — the site is large and involves a lot of walking. Wear comfortable shoes and be mindful of weather, especially the risk of flash floods in narrow areas like the Siq after heavy rain. Treat carved surfaces gently and avoid climbing restricted areas. For a different atmosphere, consider the evening “Petra by Night” experience when available. Nearby trips to Little Petra or Wadi Rum pair well with a Petra visit.</p>
