          <h1 style="margin:0 0 10px;">Kaaba</h1>
          <p>The <strong>Kaaba</strong> is a cube‑shaped building at the center of the Masjid al‑Haram (the Grand Mosque) in Mecca, Saudi Arabia. It is the spiritual focal point of Islam: Muslims around the world face its direction during daily prayers, and pilgrims circle it during Hajj and Umrah. The Kaaba’s importance is not about its size or decoration, but about what it represents — unity, devotion, and a shared direction of worship. Covered by a black cloth called the <em>Kiswah</em>, the Kaaba creates a powerful visual center in a vast courtyard. For many visitors, the experience is defined by the collective movement of pilgrims and the atmosphere of reverence rather than by architecture alone.</p>

          <h2 style="margin-top:18px;">History & significance</h2>
          <p>Islamic tradition connects the Kaaba to Prophet Ibrahim (Abraham) and his son Ismail, and the structure has been rebuilt and renovated multiple times over centuries. One notable feature is the <strong>Black Stone</strong> set into the eastern corner; during circumambulation (tawaf), pilgrims pass it on each circuit, and some try to touch or kiss it when it is safe to do so.</p>

          <h2>Visitor notes</h2>
          <p>Access to Mecca and the Kaaba is restricted to Muslims. If you are performing Umrah or Hajj, plan ahead for permits, crowd levels, and the physical demands of walking for long periods. Dress and behavior should follow religious guidelines, and it’s best to avoid peak heat by going late at night or early morning when possible. Stay hydrated, be patient in dense crowds, and keep your focus on safety and respectful participation. Nearby points of interest inside the mosque complex include the Zamzam water area and the Safa‑Marwa corridor.</p>
