          <h1 style="margin:0 0 10px;">Taj Mahal</h1>
          <p>The <strong>Taj Mahal</strong> in Agra, India, is a white‑marble mausoleum that many people consider the peak of Mughal architecture. It was commissioned by Emperor Shah Jahan as a memorial to his wife Mumtaz Mahal, and the entire complex is designed around balance and symmetry. The central dome, flanking minarets, reflecting pools, and formal garden create a calm, ordered experience that contrasts with the busy city outside the gates. Up close, the marble is covered with delicate carved patterns and <em>pietra dura</em> inlay — semi‑precious stones set into the surface like jewelry. The Taj Mahal matters not only for its beauty, but as a cultural symbol of love, craftsmanship, and the way empires used art and architecture to express power and faith.</p>

          <h2 style="margin-top:18px;">History & significance</h2>
          <p>Construction began in 1632 and is often dated to completion around 1653. One clever engineering detail is that the four minarets lean slightly outward, so if an earthquake occurred they would fall away from the main tomb rather than onto it. Notice how the calligraphy appears consistent from the ground — the lettering is actually scaled to compensate for height and perspective.</p>

          <h2>Visitor notes</h2>
          <p>Sunrise is the most popular time for softer light and cooler temperatures. The Taj Mahal is typically closed on Fridays for prayers, so plan your days accordingly. Visitors remove shoes or wear shoe covers inside, and food is restricted. Keep your visit respectful and avoid loud behavior inside the mausoleum area. Nearby, Agra Fort and Mehtab Bagh (across the river) provide great views and historical context.</p>
