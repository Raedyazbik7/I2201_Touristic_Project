          <h1 style="margin:0 0 10px;">Great Wall of China</h1>
          <p>The <strong>Great Wall of China</strong> is not a single continuous wall, but a vast network of fortifications that stretches across northern China. Built and rebuilt over many centuries, its purpose was to protect border regions, control trade routes, and signal movement through watchtowers and beacon systems. The wall’s scale is the most impressive thing: it runs over mountains and ridgelines, connecting passes, towers, and defensive barriers that follow the natural landscape. Beyond defense, it became a symbol of national identity and persistence — a reminder of how societies invest in long‑term infrastructure. Visiting the Wall today shows how engineering choices depend on terrain: some sections use stone and brick, others compacted earth, and many parts blend into the environment where restoration has not occurred.</p>

          <h2 style="margin-top:18px;">History & significance</h2>
          <p>Early walls date back to regional states in the first millennium BCE, with major unification efforts under the Qin dynasty. The most well‑preserved sections many tourists see today were strengthened during the <strong>Ming dynasty</strong> (14th–17th centuries) using brick and stone. Look for the watchtowers: they weren’t just lookout points — they also served as communication nodes where smoke or fire signals could travel quickly along the frontier.</p>

          <h2>Visitor notes</h2>
          <p>Different sections offer different experiences: Badaling is convenient but busy, Mutianyu is family‑friendly and scenic, and Jinshanling is popular for longer hikes. Wear shoes with good grip and be prepared for steep stairs. Try to avoid national holidays when crowds surge. Please don’t carve names into bricks or remove stones — preservation depends on visitors treating the Wall as a protected heritage site.</p>
